1. How many albums does the artist Led Zeppelin have? 
SELECT *
FROM albums al
LEFT JOIN artists ar
ON al.artistid = ar.artistid
WHERE ar.name= 'Led Zeppelin'

2. Create a list of album titles and the unit prices for the artist "Audioslave". How many records are returned?
SELECT ar.name
	,alb.title AS album_titles
	,t.unitprice
FROM ((albums alb INNER JOIN artists ar ON alb.artistid = ar.artistid) 
        INNER JOIN tracks t ON alb.albumid = t.albumid)
WHERE ar.name = 'Audioslave'

3. Find the first and last name of any customer who does not have an invoice. Are there any customers returned from the query?  
SELECT DISTINCT(C.CUSTOMERID), c. firstname, c. lastname, i.invoiceid
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN invoices i
ON c.customerid = i.customerid
WHERE i.invoiceid is null

4. Find the total price for the album “Big Ones”?
select SUM(t.unitprice), al.title
from albums al
join tracks t
ON al.albumid = t.albumid
where al.title = 'Big Ones'

5. How many records are created when you apply a Cartesian join to the invoice and invoice items table?
select *
from invoices cross join invoice_items
--produced an error for taking longer than 3 seconds, so I got the right answer by simply selecting * of both tables, writing down 
the total rows of each, and multiplying them together
